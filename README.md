# News Recommendation
##In this project following steps are planned:

- The data collection is achieved via a crawler to get the news' archives from website using [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org)

-Data is formatted in csv format and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/io.html) can be used to manipulate the data.

- Try different NLP algorithms to achieve the similarity using [Gensim Library](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) in Python

- For now only LSI algorithm is implemented to achieve the similarity between news.
